# aksctl
 `aksctl` is an easy to use CLI(Command Line Utility) for creating and managing Kubernetes Cluster on Azure AKS ( Azure Kubernetes Service). It is written in Go.
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites
You will need to have Azure credentials configured. What works for AZ CLI should be sufficient. If you dont have Azure CLI installed, you can refer [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
### Installation
#### Install from source
To install aksctl, clone the repository using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adfolks/aksctl
```
Then, initiate module with:
```bash
go mod init github.com/adfolks/aksctl
```
This will create a module config file `go.mod`.
Finally, use
```bash
go build
```
to fetch the latest dependencies.
#### Install from binary (on Linux)
Download the compressed binary file by running:
```bash
   curl -LJO https://github.com/adfolks/aksctl/releases/download/v0.1.0/aksctl-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
Then, unzip the downloaded file using:
```bash
   tar xzvf aksctl-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
Run the following commands to create an executable file:
```bash
   ls aksctl
   chmod +x ./aksctl
```
Finally, run
```bash
   sudo mv aksctl/usr/bin
```
to start using aksctl.
#### Install from binary (on Mac)
Download the compressed binary file by running:
```bash
   curl -LJO https://github.com/adfolks/aksctl/releases/download/v0.1.0/aksctl-darwin-amd64.tar.gz
```

## Basic usage
A default cluster can be created by running:
  ```bash
     aksctl create cluster
  ```
  This command will be using values from `default.yaml` located at the root directory,
  edit `default.yaml` with reference to keys from `template.yaml` for specifying more parameters
  A cluster's mandatory parameters can be overridden using flags while running the command.
  ```bash
     aksctl create cluster --name
                           --rgroupname
                           --rgroupregion
  ```
  Example:
  Running the code
  ```bash
     aksctl create cluster --rgroupname myresourcegroup
  ```
  Flags can be used with shorthand name as well
  ```bash
     aksctl create cluster -r myresourcegroup
  ```
  above code will create a resource group with the name `myresourcegroup`.
  You can also customize your cluster by using a config file.
  For this, create a `.yaml` a file like `config.yaml` with reference to keys from `template.yaml`.
  Next, run the command:
  ```bash
     aksctl create cluster --file config
  ```
  to apply the `config.yaml` file.
  This will create a cluster as described in the file.
A cluster can be deleted by running:
  ```bash
     aksctl delete cluster
  ```
Get the list of clusters by running:
  ```bash
     aksctl get cluster
  ```
`aksctl` can be installed by following the above instructions.
